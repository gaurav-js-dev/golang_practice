#####In this repo there are 6 Different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach something different.

######Through the course I will learn about and practice using:

- Channels
- Mutexes
- Goroutines
- Functional Options
- Chaining Interfaces
- Various parts of the standard library (io, time, and many other packages)
- Reading input from the command line
- And much much more!

<p>By completing the exercises in Gophercises I will slowly become more confident using the Go programming language. I will start to learn how to read the standard docs and make sense of them. I will even start to learn how to evaluate the difficulty of a project before doing much coding.</p>
